# Penetration Testing Process

## Bug Bounty Programs
- [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/directory/programs)
- [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements?category=bug_bounty&page=1&sort_by=promoted&sort_direction=desc)

## Key Points
- Always have permission
- Stay within the scope of testing
- If in doubt, reach out.
- Obtain a scoping sheet **in writing**
- Do no harm
- Always work ethically and within the bounds of the law and document **everything**
- Learn by doing, figure out why something is done instead of copy pasting commands
- Remember: A penetration test is not a CTF - your task is to uncover and identify as many vulnerabilities as possible within the scope and improve the security for the tested systems
