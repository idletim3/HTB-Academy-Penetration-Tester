# About me: 
I started learning cybersecurity in 2023 with the aim of completing the Penetration Tester career path and obtaining certifications, including the HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS), TCM Practical Junior Web Tester (PJWT), and eventually BSCP/OSCP. I have no prior experience in scripting, coding, or security.

# Purpose of this repository:
This repository contains notes and scripts written while pursuing the "[Penetration Tester](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester)" pathway at Hack the Box Academy.

Lack of regular updates due to health issues.
